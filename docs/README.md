# docs/

This directory contains user-facing documentation and design notes for the project. Suggested contents:

- `architecture.md` — high level architecture and design decisions.
- `vendor-policy.md` — explanation of the vendor manifest approach and LFS guidance.
- `usage.md` — expanded usage examples and advanced workflows.

Add markdown files here rather than expanding the top-level README to keep the main page concise.
